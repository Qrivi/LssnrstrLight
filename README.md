# LssnrstrLight

Two things about my grandmother to put this project into perspective:

1.	She calls me _alot_ whenever she needs me
2.	She proudly owns a 30 EUR Android tablet


## What do?

LssnrstrLight or Lessenrooster Light is a small Android application able to process CalDAV and list current and upcoming events chronologically. And that’s all it does! It is currently feeding itself off two calendar feeds listing my academic activities.

Note that I created this application in barely two days. It’s not wow. It was crafted for my grandmother and her Android tablet she always keeps in portrait mode, so she can check the latest updates regarding my course schedule and doesn’t call me during class or an exam.

“Made with love”, but that’s everywhere nowadays.
